Chat Room has been the most basic step toward creating real-time and live projects. The chat page that we will create will be a simple HTML boilerplate with a simple h1 text with the name of the current user and a link to log out to the user who is just logged in. You may need to comment on the line until we create auth system for this. This ensures that when two users are chatting, one can log out and it will not affect the other user. The other will be still logged in and he can send and receive messages.
